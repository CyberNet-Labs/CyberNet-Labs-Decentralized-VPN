# CyberNet-Labs-Decentralized-VPN
CyberNet Labs Decentralized VPN lets peers rent bandwidth from each other over SSL/TLS tunnels, with no central server. Clients deposit tokens and stream traffic through provider nodes, while a lightweight on-disk blockchain ledger tracks deposits, usage, and reputationâ€”ensuring trustless, secure, and transparent VPN service.
